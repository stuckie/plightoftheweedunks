Plight Of The Weedunks
======================

This contains the binary and source code to Plight of the Weedunks - a Dare to be Digital 2008 game by Team Caffeine.
It contains a CodeBlocks project file which "worked at the time" but you'll need ODE, SDL 1.2, SDL Mixer, SDL Image, Lua5.1, and Horde3D to attempt to compile it.
It's more being put up here so it's not lost... there's too many interesting things lost to bit rot these days.

The binaries still run - including the Linux ones! ( though you may need to chmod +x gameStart.sh and potw.linux )
The Linux ones are 32bit, so you'll need the relevant 32bit libraries - though a compatible Horde3D is prebuilt.

Also included is the Converter source as we modified it slightly to allow us to add level bits in Maya, and push it directly through.

All of this is provided as-is.
It may be persuaded to compile, it may not.

You may use whichever bits of code you find, but the assets cannot be used for any other purpose, and are here for example and archival reasons only.
That and the source art has been lost, so it'd be relatively tricky to use the built assets anyway.

Thanks,
Steven "Stuckie" Campbell
